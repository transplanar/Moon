_Beginning in the world of Game Development, I have found a new home in software engineering, particularly test automation. Through the process of being in the trenches with code up close, I have been able to quickly learn unfamiliar technologies and methods and contribute in compelling ways in a short amount of time._

_Recent events have gotten me connecting with my core passions - living a life of purpose, introspection, and meaning beyond myself. When I am immersed in code, I become one with my work, forgetting myself and the world around me. But I don't just want an escape anymore - I want my work to ease the burdens of others and make life richer for everyone._

_Following a wonderful stint at Vacasa, I am seeking out new horizons and opportunities to grow my skills further. COVID-19 has put the whole world on edge, and I want to do my part to help out those in need with the skills I have to offer._
