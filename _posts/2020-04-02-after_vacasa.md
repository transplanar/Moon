# An Unexpected Plot Twist

_2020 has been a harrowing suprise for many people. While I am fortunate to not be among the worst effected, I was laid off from my job at Vacasa. While a shock at first, it has given me time to reflect on my time there and what I hope to accomplish next._

# QA and Automation

_Since my first experience at Sprinklr working on unit tests, I found automation a great way to learn new skills in an immersive way. Moreover, the project of making detailed test suites, figuring out edge cases, and designing tests for readability overs many interesting creative and technical challenges._

_Projecting into the future, I ask myself: do I want to stay in the world of automation indefinitely? I prefer to keep that an open question. Life has thrown many unpredictable twists my way, so I feel inclined to hedge my bets and not commit fully to a single strategy._

_In five years, I see myself involved in automation, in one form or another. Either as a software engineer following Test Driven Design principles, or an SDET helping other engineers do the same. So long as my skills are growing and I have new challenges to chase, that is my priority above all._

# Union of Two Worlds

_While I have yet to see where my career takes me, as I think about my core motivations, I think of two mindsets that animate me the most. The first is a sense of Calm, a meditative trance I find myself in when I am immersed in code. I forget myself and the world, and feel one with my work. The second is a desire for a lasting legacy, a mark on the world, and the desire to make some significant contribution to humanity - a longing for Purpose._

_With growing demand for technical talents among healthcare companies, I see an opportunity for these two motivations to become one. Perhaps there is a possibility where I no longer have to choose one or the other._

# Contingencies

_While I hope my unemployment isn't for long, I nevertheless want to be relentless in getting my name out there and keeping a steady stream of applications moving. Not just for me, but for my sister, who is studying to be a massage therapist, and my mother, who has lived a hard life and deserves some measure of comfort._

_Perhaps in the isolation of the pandemic I have realized most vividly that my story is not purely my own, and I am eager to commit my life to enrich the lives of others._
